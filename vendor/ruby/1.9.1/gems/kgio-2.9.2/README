= kgio - kinder, gentler I/O for Ruby

kgio provides non-blocking I/O methods for Ruby without raising
exceptions on EAGAIN and EINPROGRESS.  It is intended for use with the
Unicorn and Rainbows! Rack servers, but may be used by other
applications (that run on Unix-like platforms).

== Features

* Can avoid expensive exceptions on common EAGAIN/EINPROGRESS errors,
  returning :wait_readable or :wait_writable instead.
  These exceptions got more expensive to hit under Ruby 1.9.2
  (but should be fixed in Ruby 1.9.3 to 1.9.1 performance levels)

* Returns the unwritten portion of the string on partial writes,
  making it ideal for buffering unwritten data.

* May call any method defined to be "kgio_wait_writable" or
  "kgio_wait_readable" methods to allow socket/pipe objects to make custom
  callbacks (such as adding the file descriptor to a poll set and yielding
  the current Fiber).

* Uses
  {accept4}[http://kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/accept4.2.html]
  on new GNU/Linux systems to avoid unnecessary fcntl() calls

* Uses MSG_DONTWAIT on GNU/Linux to further avoid unnecessary fcntl() calls

* Compatible with existing Ruby IO objects and Ruby threading.

== Install

The library consists of a C extension so you'll need a Unix-like system
with a C compiler and Ruby development libraries/headers.
