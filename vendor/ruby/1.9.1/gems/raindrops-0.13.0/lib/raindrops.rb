# Each Raindrops object is a container that holds several counters.
# It is internally a page-aligned, shared memory area that allows
# atomic increments, decrements, assignments and reads without any
# locking.
#
#   rd = Raindrops.new 4
#   rd.incr(0, 1)   -> 1
#   rd.to_ary       -> [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ]

# Unlike many classes in this package, the core Raindrops class is
# intended to be portable to all reasonably modern *nix systems
# supporting mmap().  Please let us know if you have portability

class Raindrops

  # Used to represent the number of +active+ and +queued+ sockets for
  # a single listen socket across all threads and processes on a
  # machine.
  #
  # For TCP listeners, only sockets in the TCP_ESTABLISHED state are
  # accounted for.  For Unix domain listeners, only CONNECTING and
  # CONNECTED Unix domain sockets are accounted for.
  #
  # +active+ connections is the number of accept()-ed but not-yet-closed
  # sockets in all threads/processes sharing the given listener.
  #
  # +queued+ connections is the number of un-accept()-ed sockets in the
  # queue of a given listen socket.
  #
  # These stats are currently only available under \Linux
  class ListenStats < Struct.new(:active, :queued)

    # the sum of +active+ and +queued+ sockets
    def total
      active + queued
