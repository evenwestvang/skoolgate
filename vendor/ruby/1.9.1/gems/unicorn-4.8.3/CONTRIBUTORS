We would like to thank following folks for helping make Unicorn possible:

  format and reasonable defaults.

  and drastically cut down on the amount of code we have to maintain.
* Zed A. Shaw - for Mongrel, without which Unicorn would not be possible

The original Mongrel contributors:

* Luis Lavena
* Wilson Bilkovich
* why the lucky stiff
