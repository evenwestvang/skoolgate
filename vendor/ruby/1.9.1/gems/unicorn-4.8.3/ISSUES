We operate a {public-inbox}[http://public-inbox.org/].
You may subscribe using {ssoma}[http://ssoma.public-inbox.org/]:

	URL=git://bogomips.org/unicorn-public
	LISTNAME=unicorn

	# to initialize a maildir (this may be a new or existing maildir,
	# ssoma will not touch existing messages)
	# If you prefer mbox, use mbox:/path/to/mbox as the last argument
	# You may also use imap://$MAILSERVER/INBOX for an IMAP account
	# or imaps:// for an IMAPS account, as well.
	ssoma add $LISTNAME $URL maildir:/path/to/maildir

	# read with your favorite MUA (only using mutt as an example)
	mutt -f /path/to/maildir # (or /path/to/mbox)

	# to keep your mbox or maildir up-to-date, periodically run the following:
	ssoma sync $LISTNAME

	# your MUA may modify and delete messages from the maildir or mbox,
	# this does not affect ssoma functionality at all

	# to sync all your ssoma subscriptions
	ssoma sync

	# You may wish to sync in your cronjob
	ssoma sync --cron
