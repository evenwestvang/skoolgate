# Unicorn module containing all of the classes (include C extensions) for
# running a Unicorn web server.  It contains a minimalist HTTP server with just
# enough functionality to service web application requests fast as possible.

# \Unicorn exposes very little of an user-visible API and most of its
# internals are subject to change.  \Unicorn is designed to host Rack
# applications, so applications should be written against the Rack SPEC
# and not \Unicorn internals.

  # applications unless PrereadInput middleware is loaded.
