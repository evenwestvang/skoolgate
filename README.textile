  * MongoDB

Repo ships with all the production data dumped to a MongoDB backup. From project root just do:

</pre>

TODO

  * Return 404 instad of 500 on when looking up nonexistant schools
  * Show data for single schools even if we don't have their location
  * Single school views should use full screen maps, pushstate, onpopstate and onnavigate hookage
